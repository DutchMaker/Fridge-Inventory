# Functional Requirements

## High-Level Description

The NFC Fridge Inventory App is a mobile application designed for iOS devices, enabling users to efficiently track and manage the contents of their household fridge. Each food container is equipped with an NFC sticker. By scanning the NFC tag with the app, users can add new food items to the inventory, view details of existing items, and remove items when taken out. The inventory data is synced in real time across all devices used by the household, ensuring that everyone has an up-to-date view of the fridge contents.

## 1. Core Features

### 1.1. Add New Food Item

- User scans the NFC sticker on a food container with the app.
- The app prompts the user to enter:
  - **Description** (e.g., "Chicken Soup")
  - **Portions** (e.g., "2")
- The app automatically records the date and time of addition.
- The app stores all this information, linked to the unique NFC tag ID, in the inventory database.

### 1.2. Lookup Food Item

- User scans the NFC sticker on a container.
- The app displays:
  - Description
  - Portions
  - Date and time added

### 1.3. Remove Food Item

- User scans the NFC sticker when removing an item from the fridge.
- The app shows the item details.

## 2. Sync and Storage

- All inventory data is stored in a cloud database with real-time sync.
- All changes are reflected across all household devices instantly.
- No login or user profiles required; the inventory is shared.
- Data persists after app closure or device restart.

## 3. NFC Integration

- NFC scanning is required for all app actions (add, lookup, remove).
- Each NFC tagâ€™s unique ID links to a single inventory entry.
- When scanning a new tag, the app prompts for item info. When scanning a known tag, it retrieves stored data.

- iOS-only, installed via sideloading (Xcode, TestFlight, or Expo tools).
- No App Store distribution needed.

## 2. Recommended Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo (TypeScript preferred for code assist compatibility)
- **NFC Integration:** `expo-nfc` or a compatible library
- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore (real-time, free tier)
- **Cloud Sync:** All inventory data synced in real time using Firebase

## 3. Data Model

- Each inventory entry contains:
